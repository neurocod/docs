Linux Quickstart
----------------

The simplest way to start from scratch with the command line client,
automatically syncing blockchain and creating a wallet, is to just run
this command (without arguments) from the directory containing your
emercoind binary:

	$ ./emercoind

To run with the standard GUI interface:

	$ ./emercoin-qt
