**EMW (Emercoin Workspace)** is a system of
[Emercoin](../Emercoin) project work organization. This is the
main page of the workgroup.

What EMW is
-----------

EMW is a toolkit intended to organize an effective work of Emer
community development

As the blockchain is distributed, decentralized system, in reality it
can’t has a single proprietor and therefore a centralized management.
There is no way to prohibit anyone who wishes to use the blockchain, to
do the development of the projects, using the blockchain or payment
system, made on its basis. Similarly there is no way to commit someone
to fulfil these actions. Nevertheless it does not prevent (and mustn’t
prevent) an existence of development centralized groups, adoption or
operation of blockchain

The object of EMW is to give a complete and convenient toolkit as much
as possible for all comers who would like to join to Emer blockchain
development and use.

Any comer has the right to use (or not to use) all or a part of given
servises, materials etc

Nevertheless some materials can have limited access (see “limits of
access”). The EMW root structure has no limits by itself.

Some resources presented in EMW can have access limit For instance,
projects doing by company followers, can contain a trade secret and
require NDA confirmation for access Some parties may be relactant to
