# Proof-of-Work block generation

Emercoin is now [merge-mined](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification) with
Bitcoin using the same SHA-256 [Proof-of-Work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) (PoW)
algorithm. Merge-mining enhances Emercoin's blockchain [security
model](../Introduction/Security_Principles) as Emercoin can benefit from mining
power directed to the Bitcoin network. Any pool that mines Bitcoin can now also mine Emercoin as well, for little overhead.

-   Please ask your favorite [Bitcoin pool](https://blockchain.info/pools) to offer Emercoin merged-mining if they don't already.
-   To see which mining pools offer merged-mining, see this [comparison of mining pools](http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Comparison_of_mining_pools) (check the merged-mining column).
-   It is also possible to merge-mine Emercoin in a completely decentralised way with [p2pool](http://p2pool.org)
-   Additional pools that support Emercoin may be listed [here](../Links_&_Resources#page_PoW-Mining-Pools-and-Info).
